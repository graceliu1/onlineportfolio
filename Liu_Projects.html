              <p class="card-text text-center">Over the summer, I took Biology with Research
              at a Dublin Partners In Education program (DPIE). I participated in
              the science fair with Andrea Jia and our project was titled "The 
              Effect of Luminol Concentration and Temperature on Chemiluminescence." 
              ~Our science fair project focused on the topic of luminescence and 
              the best conditions in which light could endure. We were first 
              inspired by the topic of bioluminescence, the natural emission of 
              light in living organisms, and the scientific application of this 
              to our current needs. Due to our inability to obtain actual bioluminescent
              organisms, we decided to model the process with chemiluminescence, 
              the production of light through chemical reactions.  For all intents
              and purposes, the reactions are very similar. ~The above is a
              direct excerpt from the final report submitted to Megan Sininger at 
              the Science Fair.</p>

              <p class="card-text text-center">This project was part of my Computer Science 
              Principles class and spanned about three weeks. The objective was to 
              design a successful app using Massachusetts Institute of Technology
              App Inventor software. My role in the project was a documentor and
              programmer. My partner was Edward He. At the beginning of this project, 
              we chose a tutorial from the website and developed it further. 
              The primary objective of our final game was to win by gaining 25 points
              and complete three different levels. To make the game 
              interactive, we added the features of a health bar, self-firing auto
              sprites, and a reset button. Some challenges we faced during this project
              were successfully creating an auto sprite that could fire back with
              any glitches. We were able to get feedback on our game from two seperate
              gallery walks where other classmates reviewed us. Overall, this project
              taught me important skills about using a new type of coding "language."
              In addition, I gained team experience by working with a partner.</p>
