              Principles class and spanned about three weeks. The objective was to 
              design a successful app using Massachusetts Institute of Technology
              App Inventor software. My role in the project was documenting in our 
              <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uHS5U4B0CO4MvFTcYoNHEMSEeU_jzbKetB3250iIzkY/edit?usp=sharing">
              online notebook</a> and programming. My partner was Edward He. At the 
              beginning of this project, we chose a tutorial from the website and developed it further. 
              The primary objective of our final game was to win by gaining 25 points
              and complete three different levels. To make the game 
              interactive, we added the features of a health bar, self-firing auto
              sprites, and a reset button. Some challenges we faced during this project
              were successfully creating an auto sprite that could fire back with
              any glitches. We were able to get feedback on our game from two seperate
              gallery walks where other classmates reviewed us. Overall, this project
              taught me important skills about using a new type of coding language. I also learned how to
              successfully debug a program. 
              In addition, I gained team experience by working with a partner.</p>

              <p class="card-text">During second semester of the 2018-2019,
              I worked on an image manipulation project with my partner Megna Sankaranarayan.
              I coded this project in Python and created a variety of different 
              manipulations that could be applied to inputted images. The topic was 
              related to family, so the project brand was titled "Family Framers."
              One of my accomplishments was addding a color parameter to all our frames 
              so the user could choose how they wanted the frame to look. I created six 
              different manipulations, among them including black and white, abstract, and
              cutout shapes. I also used masks to create a sticker shape frame that could be 
              applied to any uploaded photos. My main role was code developement. Through this project, I learned 
              how to make efficient use of the Python Image Library (PIL) and numpy manipulations. 
              Even though I focused on coding this project, I also worked with my 
              partner to collaborate on 
                  <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13KM5L9wl0qfMXVpkefxXCYbUWJxAoTuiiZ0woU6W7WA/edit?usp=sharing">
              documentation</a>. The documentation displayed the different combinations of frames with photos. 
                  At the end of the project, we created 
              an online

                      The goal was to design a scale prototype with power from solar cells or hydrogen fuel cells and make
                      a reconmendation to Tesla. My teammates were Suhani Bhakta, Kauri Mansfield, and Nirupama Suravarjjala.
                      My role in the project was working on our <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1af4w43gsodobsPl2xBDkm3NAbdDzaab6rQ1Vdr8sYVI/edit?usp=sharing">
                      online notebook</a> and being one of the main builders on our
                      team. I worked with my group members to come up with the final design, which was a car built with a
                      single steel c-channel and powered by various configurations of solar and hydrogen fuel cells connected to a breadboard
                      and motor. The motor only powered a single wheel, but successfully moved our car. Another contribution I made
                      to the project was wiring the different configurations on our car, with both parallel and series circuits.
                      We ultimately chose to recommend hydrogen as the power source due to its higher reliability. Although solar power 
                      was usually faster, there was a chance of damaged solar panels affecting the performance of our car. 
                      After finishing the build, I was responsible for creating the modification logs on our documentation.</p>

                      My partner was Erika Tran. The goal was to design a bridge using West Point Bridge Designer 
                      under several specified constraints, such as cost and stability. My main role in the project was 
                      developing two specific designs and modifying them to create the ideal bridge. I also worked on
                      <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hsyctp5SolWyrxJhtBre4zDsSEiZQCTp11sOKbiAcqc/edit?usp=sharing">documentation</a>. 
                      Although we started with four possible bridge designs, we were able to narrow our options
                      down to one after using a decision matrix. The three characteristics used to determine the final bridge design were
                      stability, aesthetics, and cost. The final bridge design consisted of a modified truss
                      with a pier in the center of the river. This bridge design successfully minimized the forces of tension
                      and compression, which resulted in a stable bridge. The deck elevation was 12 meters and used high-strength concrete
                      The overall cost was under $300,000.00. I also contributed to our final

                      The goal was to design an educational game using Java. My group decided to use Greenfoot to code our project. Our overall
                      project theme was an educational map game that took players around the world and provided trivia questions about different 
                      cities. We also incorporated a Google Maps API into our project to provide both an accurate representation of the countries
                      and a visual user experience. My teammates were Riya Kulkanari, Stacy Glushchenko, and Shriya Rudrashettty.

                      a milestone chart, which is detailed in the documentation. Another specific contribution I made
                      to the project was figuring out how exactly to incorporate the Google Maps API into Greenfoot. As Google changed their restrictions
                      since the last version was made, I had to figure out how to fix this issue. Overall, two important skills I learned were 
                      how to more effectively navigate the Google Maps API and how to use Greenfoot effectively to create an interactive game.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">This project took place during the first semester of my AP Computer Science Applications class.
                      There were two main components of this project. My partners for the second component were Ria Jain and Jenny Wang.
                      The goal was to create an interactive icon on the Greenfoot class seating chart and play a sound or animation when
                      the photo was clicked. Another secondary goal was to include a clip of my name being pronounced. My main role in the first project was 
                      developing my creative animation. In the second project, the goal was to use Greenfoot to develop a lesson about an
                      important topic in Java. My group selected 2D Arrays. Our lesson taught students how to instantiate 2D arrays, as well as
                      loop through them to find different objects. We covered using two for loops to go through rows and columns respectively. We also linked a
                      Youtube video through Greenfoot. I worked on
                      <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17U_2yqYnbC4gpIYQSBEEClDZSNC4D5t38SGbU9HEB4M/edit?usp=sharing">notes</a> that
                      we shared with the class. Finally, I also contributed to our final 
                      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prXUe8rXlp8&feature=youtu.be">screencast</a>. 
                      Finally, I was responsible for part of the code for the screencast and a large section of the lesson notes. </p>
