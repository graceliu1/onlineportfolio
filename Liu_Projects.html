              <p class="card-text text-center">This project was part of my Computer Science 
              Principles class and spanned about three weeks. The objective was to 
              design a successful app using Massachusetts Institute of Technology
              App Inventor software. My role in the project was documenting in our 
              <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uHS5U4B0CO4MvFTcYoNHEMSEeU_jzbKetB3250iIzkY/edit?usp=sharing">
              online notebook</a> and programming. My partner was Edward He. At the 
              beginning of this project, we chose a tutorial from the website and developed it further. 
              The primary objective of our final game was to win by gaining 25 points
              and complete three different levels. To make the game 
              interactive, we added the features of a health bar, self-firing auto
              sprites, and a reset button. Some challenges we faced during this project
              were successfully creating an auto sprite that could fire back with
              any glitches. We were able to get feedback on our game from two seperate
              gallery walks where other classmates reviewed us. Overall, this project
              taught me important skills about using a new type of coding "language."
              In addition, I gained team experience by working with a partner.</p>

              <p class="card-text text-center">During second semester of the 2018-2019,
              I worked on an image manipulation project with my partner Megna Sankaranarayan.
              This project was coded in Python and provided a variety of different 
              manipulations that could be applied to inputted images. Our topic was 
              focused on family, so our project brand was titled "Family Framers." In the beginning, 
              we brainstormed different ideas on what we wanted our final product to look like.
              We came up with the idea of having the customers choose from a variety of options.
              Later, we also added a color parameter to all our frames so the user could choose 
              how they wanted the frame to look. We created six different manipulations,
              among them including black and white, abstract, and cutout shapes. I 
              developed a large portion of the code for this
              project. This project also helped learn how to make efficient use of the
              Python Image Library (PIL) and numpy manipulations. 
              Even though I focused on coding this project, I also worked with my 
              partner to collaborate on <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13KM5L9wl0qfMXVpkefxXCYbUWJxAoTuiiZ0woU6W7WA/edit?usp=sharing">
              documentation</a>. At the end of the project, we created 
              an online <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NBqiLPX3J_OJnm7bchkS7KxMZ_6E2Xf6G-Y9oI4CXkw/edit?usp=sharing">
