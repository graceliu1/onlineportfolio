              Principles class and spanned about three weeks. The objective was to 
              design a successful app using Massachusetts Institute of Technology
              App Inventor software. My role in the project was documenting in our 
              <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uHS5U4B0CO4MvFTcYoNHEMSEeU_jzbKetB3250iIzkY/edit?usp=sharing">
              online notebook</a> and programming. My partner was Edward He. At the 
              beginning of this project, we chose a tutorial from the website and developed it further. 
              The primary objective of our final game was to win by gaining 25 points
              and complete three different levels. To make the game 
              interactive, we added the features of a health bar, self-firing auto
              sprites, and a reset button. Some challenges we faced during this project
              were successfully creating an auto sprite that could fire back with
              any glitches. We were able to get feedback on our game from two seperate
              gallery walks where other classmates reviewed us. Overall, this project
              taught me important skills about using a new type of coding "language."
              In addition, I gained team experience by working with a partner.</p>

              <p class="card-text">During second semester of the 2018-2019,
              I worked on an image manipulation project with my partner Megna Sankaranarayan.
              I coded this project in Python and created a variety of different 
              manipulations that could be applied to inputted images. The topic was 
              related to family, so the project brand was titled "Family Framers."
              One of my accomplishments was addding a color parameter to all our frames 
              so the user could choose how they wanted the frame to look. I created six 
              different manipulations, among them including black and white, abstract, and
              cutout shapes. I also used masks to create a sticker shape frame that could be 
              applied to any uploaded photos. My main role was code developement. Through this project, I learned 
              how to make efficient use of the Python Image Library (PIL) and numpy manipulations. 
              Even though I focused on coding this project, I also worked with my 
              partner to collaborate on 
                  <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13KM5L9wl0qfMXVpkefxXCYbUWJxAoTuiiZ0woU6W7WA/edit?usp=sharing">
              documentation</a>. The documentation displayed the different combinations of frames with photos. 
                  At the end of the project, we created 
              an online 
                  <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NBqiLPX3J_OJnm7bchkS7KxMZ_6E2Xf6G-Y9oI4CXkw/edit?usp=sharing">

                      The goal was to design a scale prototype with power from solar cells or hydrogen fuel cells and make
                      a reconmendation to Tesla. My teammates were Suhani Bhakta, Kauri Mansfield, and Nirupama Suravarjjala.
                      My role in the project was working on our <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1af4w43gsodobsPl2xBDkm3NAbdDzaab6rQ1Vdr8sYVI/edit?usp=sharing">
                      online notebook</a> and being one of the main builders on our
                      team. I worked with my group members to come up with the final design, which was a car built with a
                      single steel c-channel and powered by various configurations of solar and hydrogen fuel cells connected to a breadboard
                      and motor. The motor only powered a single wheel, but successfully moved our car. Another contribution I made
                      to the project was wiring the different configurations on our car, with both parallel and series circuits.
                      We ultimately chose to recommend hydrogen as the power source due to its higher reliability. 
                      After finishing build, I was responsible for creating the modification logs on our documentation.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">This project was part of my second semester POE class.
                      My partner was Erika Tran. The goal was to design a bridge using West Point Bridge Designer 
                      under several specified constraints, such as cost and stability. My main role in the project was 
                      developing two specific designs and modifying them to create the ideal bridge. I also worked on
                      documentation. Although we started with four possible bridge designs, we were able to narrow our options
                      down to one after using a decision matrix. The final bridge design consisted of a modified truss
                      with a pier in the center of the river. This bridge design successfully minimized the forces of tension
                      and compression, which rendered our bridge to be stable. The overall cost was under $300,000.00. 
                      In addition 
                      to contributing to design, I also contributed our final presentation. I was responsible for creating the final 
                      design summary and parts of the modification logs. </p>
