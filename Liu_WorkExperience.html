                        As a final-year student in the Engineering and Design Academy at Dublin High, 
                        I have met many industry professionals through workplace field trips and guest speakers.
                        These experiences have provided a valuable preview into different fields of engineering. 
                        Having the opportunity to ask questions and see the environment of these professionals 
                        has been one of the most rewarding parts of my high school journey so far.
                    </p>
                    <p class="specialfont2">~field trips~
                    </p>
                    <p class="specialfont2">
                        The first field trip I participated in was Manufacturing Day - a visit with students 
                        from around the Tri-Valley to several companies. The company that I visited was Kensington 
                        Laboratories. We were able to tour the companies and see their primary products. When 
                        we arrived at Kensington Laboratories, we met with several general managers to take a
                        tour of their facility. They specialized in wafer-handling robots, from their manufacture
                        to repairs. I learned that wafers are flat silicon disks that serve as semiconductors for
                        circuits. They can be cut apart to form small computer chips that are sent to other major
                        companies like Intel for processing. <!--One of the lead engineers showed us their newest design, 
                        a wafer-handling robot that would pick up the disks and stack them in a different location. 
                        He also explained that the code used for the system was specific to the company. I thought
                        that this experience was especially interesting because of the integration of both mechanical
                        and electrical engineering. Before visiting this company, I thought that manufacturers like
                        Intel were the sole producers of computer chips. However, I learned that there are a multitude
                        of other small firms that form the supply chain and provide all of the equipment necessary to
                        design a functional computer chip. -->

                        The second virtual field trip I attended was the Junior Achievement Virtual Job Shadow with Oracle in 2020.
                        I attended this job shadow to learn about people at Oracle's experiences with their career. One presenter
                        was Gloria Cheng. I remember learning about her graduation from UC Berkeley and subsequent work experience
                        at IBM and then Oracle. Hearing about her progression as a women in STEM was interesting because I participated 
                        in the Girls Who Code Club myself. Overall, her talk was very inspiring.

                        The third field trip I participated in was the Junior Achievement Virtual Job Shadow with Salesforce in 2020. 
                        I attended this job shadow to learn about people at Salesforce's daily work roles. I listened to several individuals
                        narrate their experiences working in the technology after graduating from schools like the University of Southern Carolina. Overall,
                        this inspired me to consider alternative paths to a career in tech companies besides obtaining a bachelor's in computer science.
                        Individuals who minor or major in the humanities in undergrad can also take on roles as well.

                        The last field trip I attended was the CTE webinars. Specifically, the two I attended were the webinars on
                        Biotechnology and Teaching. The Biotechnology webinar featured students from Diablo Valley College discussing 
                        their experiences in the intersection of  engineering and biology. They talked about their college professors and 
                        courses that allowed them to gain practical lab experience, even at laboratories like Sandia National Labs. The Teaching 
                        webinar was on teaching as a possible path. Though I've always wanted to work in a software company, I think that 
                        learning about why California needs more teachers helped educate me on the importance of guiding young minds.

                    <p class="specialfont2">~guest speakers~
                    </p>
                    <p class="specialfont2">
                        One of the guest speakers that visited my Principles of Engineering classroom was Jason Yosinski,
                        a machine learning scientist who had previously worked in Uberâ€™s AI Labs. He explained some of 
                        his research relating to neural networks and also focused on a few projects he worked on in 
                        college. For example, he built a spider-like robot that used machine learning and neural networks 
                        to figure out the best way to walk. <!--The robot would try many different ways of movement with its
                        robotic legs in order to determine the position that would move it the furthest in the least time.
                        Personally, the idea I found most fascinating from his presentation was the relation of artificial
                        intelligence to language processing, specifically speech recognition and natural language conversion. 
                        With the advent of neural networks, software like Google Translate can use a variety of language 
                        models to interpret words in different contexts. Like some of Yosinskiâ€™s studies, I want to research 
                        aspects of artificial intelligence related to language.--> I find it fascinating how by studying enormous 
                        amounts of text found on the Internet, models can generate blocks of text that are logical coming from 
                        a computer system.

                        Another guest speaker talk that I attended was virtually with Emma Schoenthal, a civil engineer who graduated 
                        from UCSD and talked about her experiences choosing her career path. I learned that not immediately knowing 
                        your path entering college is a common issue that many students face. While exploring classes at UCSD and taking
                        internships at different environmntal technology companies, Ms. Schoenthal was able to decide on her career path. I thought 
                        that her lecture was very interesting because she incorporated the perspective of a previous Dublin High School student.
                    </p>
                    <p class="specialfont2">
                        My third guest speaker event also occurred virtually with Andrea Madotto, who was a PhD candidate at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)
                        and another natural language processing scientist. Like Jason Yoskinski, he had extensive experience with modelling conversations and
                        working on generative language models. I thought that his research on the latest attempts to simulate AI and human speech patterns was 
                        especially interesting. Later in my AP Computer Science Applications class, I worked on creating a simple chatbot. It was enlightening to hear
                        about the cutting-edge research being conducted on natural language processing. 
                    </p>
                    <p class ="specialfont2">
                        Kimberli Zhong was the final guest speaker at a talk I attended in my senior year. Her focus was on her experiences in high school, to 
                        her schooling at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), to her career path. I got to hear about how she participated in the first
                        cohort of the Engineering and Design Academy as well as her role in the Gael Force Robotics. Like Ms. Schoenthal, hearing from people who
                        attended Dublin High always provides an unique perspective. Finally, I learned about her experience finding summer internships in companies like 
                        AirBnb and Google.
                    </p>
                    <p class="specialfont2">
                        As a junior, I also participated in the mentorship program with an industry professional. My assigned mentor
                        was James Morehead, a current product manager at Google. Through our monthly mentor meetings, I received much beneficial
                        advice surrounding college and pursuing a career in the software industry. For example, one of the meetings I learned the most from
                        was the mock job interview. I greatly appreciated listening to advice on remaining calm and thinking through curveball questions.
                        I also learned how to present myself and my experiences by telling short stories. This prepared me for several interviews for summer programs.
                        Another meaningful experience was discussing future plans for college. Discussions with my mentor helped put college into perspective. I look
                        forward to implementing these lessons in my life and career.
