                        As a first-year student in the Engineering and Design Academy at Dublin High, 
                        I have met several industry professionals through workplace field trips and guest speakers.
                        These experiences have provided a valuable preview into different fields of engineering. 
                        Having the opportunity to ask questions and see the environment of these professionals 
                        has been one of the most rewarding parts of my high school journey so far.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="specialfont2">
                        The first field trip I participated in was Manufacturing Day - a visit with students 
                        from around the Tri-Valley to several companies. The company that I visited was Kensington 
                        Laboratories. We were able to tour the companies and see their primary products. When 
                        we arrived at Kensington Laboratories, we met with several general managers to take a
                        tour of their facility. They specialized in wafer-handling robots, from their manufacture
                        to repairs. I learned that wafers are flat silicon disks that serve as semiconductors for
                        circuits. They can be cut apart to form small computer chips that are sent to other major
                        companies like Intel for processing. One of the lead engineers showed us their newest design, 
                        a wafer-handling robot that would pick up the disks and stack them in a different location. 
                        He also explained that the code used for the system was specific to the company. I thought
                        that this experience was especially interesting because of the integration of both mechanical
                        and electrical engineering. Before visiting this company, I thought that manufacturers like
                        Intel were the sole producers of computer chips. However, I learned that there are a multitude
                        of other small firms that form the supply chain and provide all of the equipment necessary to
                        design a functional computer chip. 
                    </p>
                 
                    <p class="specialfont2">
                        One of the guest speakers that visited my Principles of Engineering classroom was Jason Yosinski,
                        a machine learning scientist who had previously worked in Uber’s AI Labs. He explained some of 
                        his research relating to neural networks and also focused on a few projects he worked on in 
                        college. For example, he built a spider-like robot that used machine learning and neural networks 
                        to figure out the best way to walk. The robot would try many different ways of movement with its
                        robotic legs in order to determine the position that would move it the furthest in the least time.
                        Personally, the idea I found most fascinating from his presentation was the relation of artificial
                        intelligence to language processing, specifically speech recognition and natural language conversion. 
                        With the advent of neural networks, software like Google Translate can use a variety of language 
                        models to interpret words in different contexts. Like some of Yosinski’s studies, I want to research 
                        aspects of artificial intelligence related to language. I find it fascinating how by studying enormous 
                        amounts of text found on the Internet, models can generate blocks of text that are logical coming from 
                        a computer system.
