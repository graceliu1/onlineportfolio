                        I am interested in software engineering and hope to achieve my goal of working in artificial intelligence
                        and machine learning after college. By the end of my high school career, I hope to have sufficiently 
                        developed a basis for higher level education in the future.</p>

                    <p style = "text-align: left" class="text-justify-left float-right specialfont2">Last year, I took Computer Science Principles (CSP) in the 2018-2019
                        school year to gain basic knowledge about different programming languages. Currently, 
                        I am taking Honors Principles of Engineering. As a member of the software development
                        path of the Dublin High Engineering and Design Academy, I strive to develop my coding 
                        skills. Next year, I plan to take AP Computer Science Applications as one of my electives. In addition to school courses, I am participating in several science
                        and engineering related activities in order to gain more experience. For example, I am a member of 5327C, 
                        a Gael Force Robotics competition team. This year, I am also the secretary of the Girls Who Code club
                        at Dublin High School. In the 2018-2019 school year, I founded a club called Girls Math Association.
                        I have previous experience in Java and Python. Aside from engineering, I enjoy reading, playing piano,
                        drawing, and playing badminton with my friends. My experiences have taught me the value of creativity 
                        and determination. Overall, I am adaptable and open towards learning new concepts. When working with 
                        others, I am a flexible follower or leader.  </p>

                        because of the many opportunities for future development. Technology has become a central aspect 
                        of our lives in the modern world. To keep up with the demand, more engineers are needed. I aspire
                        to contribute to technological progress. I hope that you have learned more about me and my values
