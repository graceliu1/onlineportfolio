                    <p class="text-justify float-right">Hey! My name is 
                    Grace Liu and I hope to become a experienced programmer by 
                    the end of my high school career. I have a strong interest 
                    in engineering, especially software-based, and I applied for
                    this course to start learning more about code. During my 
                    sophomore year, I hope to become a member of Dublin High 
                    Schoolâ€™s Engineering Academy. Before taking this course, 
                    I have taken lessons in Java and Python outside of school.
                    They helped me gain a basic understanding of the languages, 
                    but little experience in coding with them. Computer Science 
                    Principles has already given me opportunities to work on
                    developing projects with other people that have similar 
                    interests. I am interested in STEM because of the 
                    opportunities in those fields.</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p class="text-justify float-right">Extracurricular 
                    activities are important to me. As of now, I have been
                    playing piano for eight years. Last May, I was able to win 
                    fourth place at the United States Open Music Competition in 
                    the showcase category for ages 13-16. This school year I 
                    will finish the final level of the Certificate of Merit music
                    examination. After freshman year, I plan to continue playing
                    piano, whether it be as a hobby or a competitive activity. 
                    Even though it did not start out that way, music has now 
                    become a way for me to relax. The most rewarding part of my 
                    journey as a pianist was not in my results but in the lessons
                    I learned from practicing. I am part of a music organization
                    called Music For You and our members are made of students
                    across Tri-Valley. Every few months, we perform at senior 
                    homes near us. In my free time, I also draw and play 
                    badminton with friends. I plan to tryout for the badminton
                    team in the spring. The club I participate the most in is
                    GAEL Force Robotics. Right now, I am on 5327R, one of the
                    five competition teams in the club. Since I am a new member,
                    I learn a lot of information from more experienced members. 
                    I have tried out notebooking, programming, and building.</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p class="text-justify float-right">As a student, I 
                    strive to maintain a balance between my academics and 
                    extracurriculars. I hope that you have learned more about me
                    as a person from reading this page. Please feel free to
