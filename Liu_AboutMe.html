                    <p class="text-justify float-right">Hello! My name is Grace 
                    Liu and I am currently a freshman here at Dublin High School. 
                    I am interested in software engineering and hope to develop a
                    solid background to reach my goal of working in a field of 
                    computer science.</p>
                    
                    
                    <!--second paragraph of information starts-->
                    
                    <p class="text-justify float-right">To accomplish this, I am 
                    participating in several STEM-related activities allowing me 
                    to gain more experience.  For example, I am a member of a Gael 
                    Force Robotics competition team, and participating in hackathons
                    with a team of students. I have also founded a club called Girls 
                    Math Association at my high school. Currently, I am a member of 
                    the software development path of the Dublin High Engineering Academy 
                    (DEDA). I have previous experience in Java and Python. By the end of
                    my high school career, I hope to have sufficiently developed a basis
                    for any job I am considering in the future. </p> 
                    
                    <!--third paragraph of information starts-->
                    
                    <p class = "text-justify float-right">So why did I choose to pursue a 
                    career in STEM? In short, it was because of its relevance and
                    opportunities for future development. Technology has become 
                    such a central aspect of our lives, and the world needs more
                    engineers. I aspire to make an impact in any field I will work 
                    in, and I believe I can do so in engineering. </p>
                    
                    <!--fourth paragraph of information starts-->
                    
                    <p class="text-justify float-right">Even though I remain focused 
                    on these pursuits, I still continue my participation in other 
                    extracurricular activities. As of now, I have been playing piano
                    for eight years. After freshman year, I plan to continue playing
                    piano, regardless of as an competitive activity or hobby. Music
                    has now become a way for me to relax. I am part of a music 
                    organization called Music For You consisting of students across
                    the Pleasanton, Dublin, and San Ramon. We regularly perform at 
                    senior homes near us. In my free time, I enjoy 
                    <a target="_blank" href="Images/dogpic.jpg">drawing</a>, playing
                    badminton with my friends, poetry, and singing. Overall, my 
                    participation in team events has helped me learn how to 
                    effectively work with others towards a common goal. From my
                    different experiences, I have learned that I value creativity
                    and determination. I am extremely adaptable and open towards
                    learning new concepts. When working with others, I often take 
                    the role of leader, but I also a flexible follower.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify float-right">As a student, I 
                    strive to maintain a balance between my academics and 
                    extracurriculars. I hope that you have learned more about me
