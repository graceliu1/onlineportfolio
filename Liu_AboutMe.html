                    <p class="text-justify float-right"><em></em>Hello! My name is 
                    Grace Liu and I am currently a freshman here at Dublin High School. 
                    I have a strong interest in engineering, especially software-based,
                    and I hope to develop a solid background in engineering to reach my goal of 
                    working in a field of computer science. To reach this goal,
                    I plan on applying to Dublin High Schoolâ€™s Engineering Academy as well as
                    participating in activites that allow me to gain a better
                    understanding of these subjects. Examples include relevant clubs,
                    such as robotics, and technology-based classes or programs. Before taking 
                    this course, I took lessons in Java and Python outside of school.
                    They helped me gain a basic understanding of the languages, 
                    but little experience in coding with them. By the end of my high school career,
                    I hope to have sufficiently developed a basis for any job in the future.
                    I am interested in STEM because of the endless possiblities and opportunities.</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p class="text-justify float-right">Extracurricular 
                    activities are important to me. As of now, I have been
                    playing piano for eight years. After freshman year, I plan to continue playing
                    piano, whether it be as a hobby or a competitive activity. 
                    Even though it did not start out that way, music has now 
                    become a way for me to relax. The most rewarding part of my 
                    journey as a pianist was not in my results but in the lessons
                    I learned from practicing. I am part of a music organization
                    called Music For You and our members are made of students
                    across Tri-Valley. Every few months, we perform at senior 
                    homes near us.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify float-right">In my free time, I enjoy
                    drawing and playing badminton with friends. I plan to tryout for the badminton
                    team at Dublin High School in the spring. The club I participate 
                    the most in currently is GAEL Force Robotics. Right now, I am on 5327R, one of the
                    five competition teams in the club. Since I am a new member,
                    I learn a lot of information from more experienced members. 
                    I have tried out notebooking, programming, and building. I believe
                    my participation in team events has helped me learn how to
                    effectively work with others towards a common goal. From my
                    different experiences, I have learned that I value creativity
                    and determination. I am always open to learning new things. 
                    When working with others, I am a flexible
                    leader or follower. </p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p class="text-justify float-right">As a student, I 
                    strive to maintain a balance between my academics and 
                    extracurriculars. I hope that you have learned more about me
                    and my values from reading this page. To contact me, please go
